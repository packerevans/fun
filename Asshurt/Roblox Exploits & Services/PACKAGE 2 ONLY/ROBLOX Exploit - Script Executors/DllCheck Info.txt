Asshurt currently does not fla the dll injection check. Asshurt will guarantee no ban usage via 'flagging'
as long as you use asshurts defaultly included injector. 

How are we 'so positive' and why can you trust what I say?
Asshurts goal is to provide a secure and enjoyable roblox gaming experience for our users.
As safety precautions, asshurt gives itself a random name every single time it's used.
It's never the same, not even for the injector! Not only that, but the second its injected
it completely erases it's own module making it not appear as it's even inside roblox at all.
If you use something like PETOOLS, and look through the loaded DLL's in roblox, you wont find
a single trace of sirhurts dll anywhere. thats because it gets rid of itself instantly on injection.

therefor:
-theres nothing roblox can specificlly scan for to flag in the first place. it's name is not consistant, it's not detectable just by scanning through roblox's loaded dlls, 
and the injector simply isn't named 'injector'. if you pay attention, its title is completely random
jibberish.

if you still don't think I know what i'm talking about, I have used sirhurt (my own product) on my
main account that has over 300k in robux along with a sparkle time, valk, domino crown (counterfit)
and shitloads of hats and even a owned group with over 10k members. absolutely nothing has happened
to me at all using my product, and i'm so certain that nothing will happen that i'll gladly use asshurt
on my main account at any given time or request.

On the countrary, that doesn't mean you wont get banned for using exploits. People can still report
you if you make it clearly known you are exploiting, and we can't control player reports. I can guarantee
loading the exploit itself / injecting it won't get you a ban. I can't however control other players
or how you decide to go about using the exploit.

Asshurt of course is a paid product. you can access our services via our website, www.asshurthosting.pw
I appreciate all purchases, as I am a adult and that money helps me pay my bills :)!

As always, for the past previous 3 years asshurt has been existance, I thank you all for your loyalty and continous support of our services.
