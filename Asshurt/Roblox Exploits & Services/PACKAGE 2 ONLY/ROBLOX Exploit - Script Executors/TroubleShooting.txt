all 3 must be installed for it to work. if you have these already, go to the search bar, type
programs and features, find the microsoft package, hit change, and hit repair. do it for all 3 of them.

sirhurt only works on windows.

if this doesn't work still after repairing/installing, try reinstalling roblox. if that doesn't work
restart your PC and try it.

that may be blocking Asshurt's host.
