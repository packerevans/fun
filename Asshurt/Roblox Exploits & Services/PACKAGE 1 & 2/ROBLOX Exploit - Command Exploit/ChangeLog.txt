added "memcheck [on/off]". Now let me explain what the purpose of this is.
Some of you have other exploits such as XYZ, RC7, and who else knows. So let me explain the purpose of this cmd as requested.
Asshurt's memcheck bypass is fired when you use a lua command such as (skybox) which is what causes the shutdown on ROBLOX.
However, things like XYZ have their own memcheck bypasses that DO NOT shut you down and work permantly. So i'll use XYZ as an example.
If you want to use XYZ's memcheck bypass instead of asshurts then you can execute this command in asshurt:
"memcheck off"
after doing this, inject XYZ into ROBLOX and wait for it to pop up. Once it pops up, it executes its memcheck bypass which lasts permantly.
Now, you could use any lua command with asshurt with 0 shutdown (such as skybox) because instead of using our memcheck
you'd be using XYZ's. Note i'm not trying to 'rip off' any other exploits memcheck bypasses. I'm just putting this as an option here
for people who would love to use asshurt and have other exploits too. I think this would be a great way for some people to be able
to use asshurt's LUA commands without any shutdown.

Switched most commands to "LUA" due to a added roblox check.
Removed a shitton of commands due to this check. Commands will be added back when they can be made. The main reason why a few of these
commands got removed was due to the fact I only had 1 hour last night to switch 90% of the commands to LUA and i did not have the time
to add some of them as they were harder to script and I didn't have the time. I'll be adding some of the commands back slowly when I have
the time to do so.

TUT- How to use explorer:
Explorer will print everything in something. Firstly, you do explorer [i] which i can be ReplicatedStorage, Players, Workspace, or Lighting.
then, it will print everything inside [i]. now, you can start scrolling through and finding stuff!
next, do explorer [o] (o) will be something it printed. Lets say, you did explorer [i] and "noob" is one of the things
it printed. noob, is in players. noob, is considered o. if you wanted to remove noob (you cant remove players but this is
an example) you would then do explorerremove [noob] which would remove noob. you must set the explorer to look somewhere
first before you do a explorerremove cmd! firstly do the explorer [i] part and have it print everything inside Players, Workspace, or Lighting, or an object you are looking through.
